Caesar was said to have borrowed the phrase from Menander, the famous Greek writer of comedy, 
whom he appreciated more than the Roman playwright Terence.[1][2] The phrase appears in Ἀρρηφόρος 
(transliterated as Arrephoros, or possibly, The Flute-Girl), as quoted in Deipnosophistae, paragraph 
8.[3] Plutarch reports that these words were said in Greek: citing Casaubon and Ruhnk, suggest that 
the text of Suetonius should read iacta alea esto (reading the third-person singular future imperative 
esto instead of the present one est), which they translate as "Let the die be cast!", or "Let the game 
be ventured!". This matches Plutarch's use of third-person singular perfect middle/passive imperative 
of the verb ἀναρρίπτω,[8] i.e. ἀνερρίφθω κύβος (anerríphthō kýbos, pronounced [anerːípʰtʰɔː kýbos]).
